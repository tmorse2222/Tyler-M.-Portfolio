User Story:AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
<br>
This is a professional portfolio built from scratch intended for use in career application processes. The main feature of this portfolio is the projects featured within, although certain requirements were also met for grading purposes in my Full-Stack Web Development course. These are as follows:<ul>
<li>Contains a name, a recent photo, and links to sections about me, my work, and contact information</li>
<li>Clicking on a nav button will send the UI to that section</li>
<li>Work section with titled images of developed apps</li>
<li>A larger image for a featured developed app</li>
<li>Images act as links to deployed apps</li>
<li>Responsive on mobile and screen shrinks</li>
</ul>
